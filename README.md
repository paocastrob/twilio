## How to stat the project?

There is an example API working with an example database. All your application code should be written inside the `./src/` folder.

- src/main.py (it's were your endpoints should be coded)
- src/mode.py (your database tables and serialization logic)
- src/utils.py (some reusable classes and functions)

For a more detailed explanation look for the tutorial inside the `docs` folder.

## Remember migrate every time you change your models

You have to migreate and upgrade the migrations for every update your make to your models:
```
$ pipenv run migrate (to make the migrations)
$ pipenv run upgrade  (to update your databse with the migrations)
```
